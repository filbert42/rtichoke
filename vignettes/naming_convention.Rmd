[**Naming Convention**]{.ul}

Some of the functions in `rtichoke` are built to work with an object that is called "performance_table" - a data frame that includes different performance metrics for different cutoffs.

But other functions are built to work estimated probabilities and outcomes. Each of these function starts with "create" (as create from scratch) - create\_\*():

create_performance_table

create_roc_curve

create_lift_curve

create_calibration_Curve

etc...
