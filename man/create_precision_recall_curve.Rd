\usage{
create_precision_recall_curve(
  probs,
  real,
  by = 0.01,
  stratified_by = "probability_threshold"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{a vector of estimated probabilities or a list of vectors of that
kind (one for each model)}

\item{real}{a vector of binary outcomes or a list of vectors of that
kind (one for each population)}

\item{by}{number: increment of the sequence.}

\item{stratified_by}{Performance Metrics can be stratified by Probability
Threshold or alternatively by Predicted Positives Condition Rate}
